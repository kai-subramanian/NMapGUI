# nmapgui

  - Built a PHP app that uses NMAP as backend, to list devices connected to the local network.
  - Run on Apache Web Server, can be viewed on a standard web browser. Tested on Google Chrome.
  - Lists out all devices connected to the local network, along with MAC Address and Vendor name, and Server timestamp.
  - Automated the scanning as a cronjob to run every 10 minutes.
  - Can be used as a monitoring tool by sysadmins to check out sus devices connected to a network.
  - Much thanks to Eli The Computer Guy for teaching how to do this:)
